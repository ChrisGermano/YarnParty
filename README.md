# YarnParty
## Spin together a Twitter story with friends!

As soon as you join, a unique name and id are generated for you, streamlining the onboarding process. Then, all you need to do is type! Every ten seconds, a random word is chosen from recent submissions and appended to progressively generated Tweet.

While you can't submit the same word more than once per cycle, multiple people can submit the same word. The word bank is public, so keep an eye on other players' submissions that tickle your funny bone. At the end of each cycle, a random word is chosen from the word bank, so multiple instances of a word give it better odds of being selected.

The top three players are awarded with amazing little emojis and on display for the world to see.


### Technical Details

YarnParty is powered by Node JS, Express, and Socket IO. This was my first foray into Socket IO development, so suggestions are welcome!
